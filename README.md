### Assignment 1

This project compares two classification models — Decision Tree and Random Forest — on the Census Income dataset.
The goal is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K based on demographic features.
Both models are implemented with scikit-learn, and their performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
